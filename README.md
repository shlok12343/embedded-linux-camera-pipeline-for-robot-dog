# Embedded Linux Camera Pipeline for Robot Dog

## Context and Motivation

- Built on a **Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W** with a **camera sensor** running **embedded Linux**
- Motivated by experience in the **Northeastern Robotics Club**, including work on **robotic platforms especially like our robot dog that rely on camera input for perception and navigation
- Focuses on **camera latency, reliability, and system-level behavior** on resource-constrained robotics hardware
- Explores the **embedded Linux camera pipeline**, including **kernel drivers**, **userspace interfaces**, and **kernel–userspace boundaries**
- Emphasizes developing a **systems-level understanding** rather than treating camera input as a black box
- Designed to support future extensions to **vision-based learning (VLA)** and other advanced robotics applications
